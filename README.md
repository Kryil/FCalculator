# A simple command line calculator using F#

A calculator that parses a string containing numbers and basic math symbols
and attempts to calculate it.

It works by tokenizing the string and creating a binary tree of the operations.

Parentheses are not yet supported and there is no error handling.

This is my first attempt at F#.
